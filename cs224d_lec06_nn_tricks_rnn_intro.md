## NOTE

### General Strategy for Implementing Model

1. Select appropriate Network Structure
  
  1.1 Structure: Single words, fixed windows vs Recursive Sentence Based vs Bag of words
  
  1.2. Nonlinearity

2. Check for implementation bugs with gradient check 
3. Parameter initialization
4. Optimization tricks
5. Check if the model is powerful enough to overfit
  
  5.1. If not, change model structure or make model "larger"
  
  5.2. If you can overfit: Regularize
